## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a student who loves exploring unprecedented and delightful blends of academic fields. I currently spend my days working in Python, exploring Neural Networks, model architectures, developments in Data Science and whatever else catches my fancy. I also love discovering new problems and thinking about the logic and statistics behind the many systems that drive the digital world today. I am someone who deeply believes that there are very few things that cannot be learnt.

I love contemplating philosophy and math and the intersections of such fields in general. I enjoy reading research papers in my leisure while I listen to songs for which my taste changes with the weather.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research/projects in the fields of AI/ML and Blockchain
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Books, Philosophy, Math and the Universe!
